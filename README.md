# Project 1
We will apply a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector designed for targets in Weibull back-ground [1]. The Weibull distribution has two parameters, named shape and scale. To run the detection test, these two parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm.

We will apply the ML-CFAR test to determine the range and range-rate of a small target embedded in sea clutter. We will use Matlab to process the radar data.

# Project 2
1. Simulate a target motion process.

2. Track the target, build a Kalman filter.

3. Build an interactive multiple model(IMM) estimator(Kalman filter) to track the target.
